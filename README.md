Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Product Reviews

## Background 
Sentiment analysis of Amazon product reviews is a crucial application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that focuses on deciphering the emotional tone behind textual reviews. This domain gained prominence with the explosion of e-commerce, where customer reviews on platforms like Amazon became a goldmine of feedback. These reviews serve a dual purpose: they guide potential buyers in their purchasing decisions and provide sellers with insights into consumer responses to their products. The process involves categorizing opinions in text to determine whether the sentiment towards a product is positive or negative. This analysis is pivotal in todayâ€™s market dynamics, as it influences consumer behavior and business strategies. The field has evolved significantly, leveraging advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to overcome challenges like varying review lengths, informal language, sarcasm, and context-dependent meanings. Initially reliant on basic methods like keyword spotting, sentiment analysis now employs sophisticated algorithms, including neural networks and sentiment classification models. Tools like NLTK in Python are commonly used, offering nuanced understanding beyond mere positive or negative classifications. As sentiment analysis shapes business decisions and product development, it also brings to light ethical considerations, particularly in data privacy and algorithmic bias, underscoring the need for responsible and sensitive handling of user-generated content.

## Motivation 
Our project is driven by the objective of harnessing the rich data embedded in Amazon product reviews. By employing sentiment analysis, we aim to construct a detailed portrait of customer sentiments, pinpointing strengths and areas needing enhancement. This nuanced understanding will be instrumental for businesses in comprehending and boosting customer satisfaction, thereby contributing to superior product offerings and a more dynamic e-commerce environment.

## Goal
Our goal is to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews to determine the customer sentiments towards various products. We aim to categorize sentiments as positive or negative and provide aggregated sentiment scores for individual products. We will compare the performance of various machine learning models, on the basis of classification and ROC score. Then, we will make use of one of these models to output the pros and cons from review data.
